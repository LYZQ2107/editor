<h2>Final Notes</h2>
<p>This is the first major update since SolvedDev's disappearance. As I am still familiarizing myself with the codebase, there is bound to be bugs. Please be patient as I grow accustomed to it. Thank you to everyone who is out there using bridge. The community gives me so much motivation to work on this project.</p>
